# Awesome Web Desktops [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

[<img src="assets/logo.png" align="right" width="100">](https://simone.computer/#/webdesktops)

The web's biggest curated directory of apps, portfolios and experiments that mimic the appearance and functionality of desktop operating systems, these are commonly known as [Web Desktops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_desktop).

![info](assets/info.png) The links are [actively monitored](https://github.com/syxanash/wd-watcher) but if you notice a dead link or would like to contribute with your own creation you're more than welcome to do so, see [contribution guide](contributing.md).<br>
