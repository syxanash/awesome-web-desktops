# Contribution Guidelines

* The website suggested must have a design which look like a typical desktop computer GUI, ideally something like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment).
* Please **do not** add websites that are hidden behind logins (without available credentials), or paywalls. If your website has a demo login please indicate it in the _User notes_.
* Only submit fully developed websites or apps that are in working condition. Projects that are in an early stage or broken will not be accepted.
* Forks of existing open source web desktops on the list are welcome only if they introduce **substantial** functional, visual, or conceptual changes beyond the original project.
* **Vibecoded**, auto-generated, or template-based projects created with no-code or automated web-app generators (e.g. Websim) are not accepted.
* Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* New categories, or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
* Check your spelling and grammar.

Please use the **following link** instead of editing the README via pull request, as the README is automatically generated using a script.
