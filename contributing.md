## Adding a new website to the list

In order to add a new site to the list you can simply add a new row to the main table in `README.md`.
The **first column** contains the favicon and the link to the website, the **second column** instead will specify if the site/project source code is available. There are no restrictions on the license on which the source code is released as long as it's been published somewhere.

A **full row** would look like this:

```
[WEBSITE_NAME](https://WEBSITE_URL) | [![open](https://i.imgur.com/NBf3juI.png) Available](https://REPOISTORY_URL) |
```

whereas if the source code is **not** available:

```
[WEBSITE_NAME](https://WEBSITE_URL) | ![locked](https://i.imgur.com/cONIqLv.png) n/a |
```

Thank you for contributing!
